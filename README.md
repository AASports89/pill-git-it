**'Pill Git It'** features pill identification function via user shared data in the form of various medication names, types, colors, imprints and images. User are able to create an account in order to view the medication data and share various information in the form of a "blog post" system. Additionally, users have the ability to edit their posts & comment on other user's posts in order to ensure data accuracy and growth.

Overall, **'Pill Git It'** follows the ```MVC``` outline referencing "full-stack" development with a JavaScript powered "back-end" and a dynamic "front-end" set up by ```Handlebars```. All of these combined languages and processes create the unique user experience while visiting the application's pages deployed via ```Heroku```.
